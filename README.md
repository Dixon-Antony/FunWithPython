# FunWithPython
This is just a fun project of Facial Recognition System.
Source : https://github.com/techwithtim/Face-Recognition

The 'faces' folder contains all the faces that the system can recognize.

You can even add your face into it. Make sure you name the image as 'YourName.jpg'

The 'test.jpg' will be the image that you want to test or compare and identify from.

You can indeed have any similar pic of yours with the name of 'test.jpg'.

In addition to ( https://github.com/techwithtim/Face-Recognition ) I've added a gtts(Google Text-to-Speech) module that reads out the name of the test image that it identified and saves it as a '.mp3' file.

Run the python code and have fun !!!
